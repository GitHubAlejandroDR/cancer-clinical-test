# Test Documentation Introduction

This introduction provides an overview of two separate documentation files: one for testing a trained XGBoost model and another for a test suite related to data processing using Pandas, Pandera, and Hydra. Both documents describe specific tests and procedures.

- [XGBoost Model Testing Documentation](test_train_model_doc.md): This documentation explains the testing process for a trained XGBoost model using Deepchecks. It covers the steps to load the model, assess accuracy and F1-score, and ensure relative degradation criteria are met.

- [Test Suite Documentation](test_process_doc.md): This README outlines a test suite for data processing. It includes test steps to process null values, remove duplicate rows, extract features and target variables, process outliers, and handle categorical data.

## Usage

- For XGBoost model testing, follow the instructions provided in the [XGBoost Model Testing Documentation](test_train_model_doc.md).

- To run the test suite for data processing, refer to the [Test Suite Documentation](test_process_doc.md) for details on each test step.

Please make sure you have the necessary dependencies and data prepared according to the documentation.
