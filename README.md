[Provide instructions on how to set up and use the MLOps project locally. Include details on prerequisites and installation steps.]

### Prerequisites

Before you begin working with this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): This project is developed in Python, and you'll need Python 3.6 or higher. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): Poetry is used for managing project dependencies and packaging. You can install Poetry by following the [official installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

Once you've installed Python and Poetry, you can proceed with setting up and working with this project.

### Installation

To get your MLOps project up and running, follow these installation steps:

1. **Clone the project repository**:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-mlops-project.git

2. Change Directory:

   ```shell
   cd your-mlops-project

3. Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Poetry installed. If not, install it following the official instructions.

Install the project's dependencies using Poetry. It will read the pyproject.toml file to manage the dependencies:

```shell
   poetry install
```

4. Activate Virtual Environment:

```shell
  poetry shell
```
## Project Structure

The MLOps project is structured to maintain a well-organized and scalable workflow for managing machine learning models, data pipelines, and automation processes. Below is an overview of the key directories and their respective roles within the project:

- **`/models`**: This directory houses trained machine learning models and their associated metadata.

  - **`/model1`**: Subdirectories for each specific model version.
    - `model.pkl`: The trained model file.
    - `metadata.json`: Model metadata, including hyperparameters and performance metrics.

- **`/data`**: Data-related files, datasets, and data versioning.

  - **`/datasets`**: Raw and processed datasets.
  - **`/features`**: Feature engineering scripts and transformations.

- **`/pipelines`**: Data processing and ML pipeline definitions.

  - **`/data_preprocessing`**: Scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing.
  - **`/model_training`**: Machine learning model training and evaluation pipelines.
  - **`/deployment`**: Deployment automation scripts for model serving.

- **`/notebooks`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model prototyping.

- **`/scripts`**: Utility scripts for various tasks, including data extraction, monitoring, and reporting.

- **`/config`**: Configuration files for environment settings, model parameters, and pipeline configurations.

- **`/tests`**: Unit tests and integration tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of pipelines and models.

- **`/docs`**: Project documentation, including guidelines, READMEs, and project-specific information.

- **`/logs`**: Log files generated by pipelines, models, and automation processes.

- **`/docker`**: Docker-related files for containerization and environment setup.

- **`/deployments`**: Scripts and configurations for model deployment, scaling, and monitoring.

This structured layout ensures that the project remains organized and follows best practices for reproducibility, scalability, and collaboration. It enables easy navigation, management, and tracking of models and pipelines in the MLOps workflow.
